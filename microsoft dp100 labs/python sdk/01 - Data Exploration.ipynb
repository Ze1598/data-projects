Notebooks consist of *cells*, some of which (like the one containing this text) are used for notes, graphics, and other content  usually written using *markdown*; while others (like the cell below this one) contain code that you can run interactively within the notebook.\n",

In this case, you're running the notebook in a *Conda* environment on an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. This environment is installed in the compute instance by default, and contains common Python packages that data scientists typically work with. It also includes the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, which is a Python package that enables you to write code that uses resources in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.\n",
